18. Write a program to solve quadratic equations. A quadratic equation is of
the form
	ax2 + bx + c = 0
If you donâ€™t know the quadratic formula for solving such an expression,
do some research. Remember, researching how to solve a problem is often
necessary before a programmer can teach the computer how to solve
it. Use doubles for the user inputs for a, b, and c. Since there are two
solutions to a quadratic equation, output both x1 and x2.
